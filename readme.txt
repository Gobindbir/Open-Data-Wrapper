This is an initial phase of the built application. The datasets from different cities which have different formats, different schemas and different fields are parsed into a similar format and schema and the mapping between final version and each city's individual file is done on the basis of configuration file entries. The latest version has not been uploaded yet as it is an ongoing process at the MCR lab at the University of Ottawa. The changes in the new version includes getting data from the APIs provided for getting open data for each city and changes have been made to the UI. Moreover, the Google APIs have been leveraged to visualize the data of different cities in the Google maps. The exported file with common platform from the uploaded version is tested by visualizing in Tableau.
